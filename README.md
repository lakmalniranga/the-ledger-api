# Ledger Rest API

Please note this project has been developed for a coding exercise.

## Getting started

1. The project requires node engine > `14.xx.xx`
1. Run `yarn install`
1. Populate a `.env` file with needed variables (check `.env.example`)
1. Run `yarn dev` to start development

## Scripts in package.json

-   `build:prod` Builds the project for production mode
-   `build:dev` Builds the project for development with hotmodule replacement
-   `dev` Starts dev server + watch for files to restart on changes
-   `watch` Runs webapck in watch mode (mostly used by `dev` script)
-   `nodemon` Runs the dev server. it's used by `dev` script.
-   `lint` Exports eslint command and requries a file/dir path to lint
-   `test` Runs jest tests

## Notes

1. Always stick to `yarn`
1. All functions should use `Named Parameters`
1. Project uses babel to transpile the code which is in `src/` directory. The output is in `build` directory.
1. Response data is enveloped:
    - For success respone : `{result: {} | []}`
    - For error response: `{error: {} | []}`
1. To send errors back to user, throw an error object with the following structure:
    ```javascript
    {
    	statusCode: 4xx,
    	message: 'Some Related Error Message',
    	name: 'ERROR_NAME' // unique id for this error type
    	...rest // any more data needed with this error
    }
    ```
1. Use in-line `if` statement, when possible
1. Use [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
